This section is a collection of 'recipes' for common tasks you can perform in the EnMAP-Box. For convenience the recipes might use and refer to the
:ref:`EnMAP-Box test dataset <test_dataset>`, but of course it is desired that you use your own data sets as well.

   We will try to continuously update this section. If you miss topics, feel free to suggest new entries here!
