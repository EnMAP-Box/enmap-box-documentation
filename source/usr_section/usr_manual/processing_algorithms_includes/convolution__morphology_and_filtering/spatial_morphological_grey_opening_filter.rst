The spatial morphological Grey Opening filter combines grey-scale erosion followed by grey-scale dilation operations to reduce noise, smooth the image, and preserve fine structures.


Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select the raster to process  and modify the parameterization if necessary, then click :guilabel:`run`.
