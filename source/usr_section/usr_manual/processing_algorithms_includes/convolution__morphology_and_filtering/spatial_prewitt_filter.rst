The Prewitt filter calculates the gradient of an image by approximating the derivative of the image intensity with respect to the spatial coordinates. It specifically focuses on detecting vertical and horizontal edges in an image.


Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select the raster to process  and modify the parameterization if necessary, then click :guilabel:`run`.

3. Processed image in comparison to the original.
