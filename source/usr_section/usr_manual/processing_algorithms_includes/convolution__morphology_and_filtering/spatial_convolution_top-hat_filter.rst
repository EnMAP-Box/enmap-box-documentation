The top hat filter is designed to enhance or extract small, bright regions or structures in an image that are significantly smaller than the size of the filterâ€™s structuring element. It is particularly useful for detecting localized objects or features against a relatively uniform background. It is an isotropic smoothing filter. It can produce artifacts when applied repeatedly on the same data. An exemplary kernel can be found below.

Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select the raster to process  and modify the parameterization if necessary, then click :guilabel:`run`.

3. Processed image in comparison to the original.
