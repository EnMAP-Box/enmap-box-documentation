The Spatial morphological White Top-Hat filter is used to extract and enhance small bright structures or features from an image. It is achieved through a combination of morphological closing and subtraction operations, isolating the desired components while suppressing lower intensity regions.


Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select the raster to process  and modify the parameterization if necessary, then click :guilabel:`run`.

3. Processed image in comparison to the original.
