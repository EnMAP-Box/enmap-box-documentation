The Trapezoid filter uses a trapezoidal weighting function. The filter assigns higher weights to values within a certain range and lower weights to pixels outside that range. It can be used to emphasize or suppress certain features in an image within a specific range of values.


Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select the raster to process  and modify the parameterization if necessary, then click :guilabel:`run`.
