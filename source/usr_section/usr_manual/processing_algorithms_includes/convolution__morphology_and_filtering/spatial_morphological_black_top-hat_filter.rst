The filter is designed to isolate specific components in an image. The Black Top-Hat filter is specifically used to extract small, dark structures that are narrower or smaller than the structuring element used.

The filter operates by performing a series of morphological operations on the input image.


Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select the raster to process  and modify the parameterization if necessary, then click :guilabel:`run`.

    .. figure:: ./img/black_tophat_filter_interface.png

3. Processed image in comparison to the original.

    .. figure:: ./img/black_tophat_filter_result.png
       :align: center
