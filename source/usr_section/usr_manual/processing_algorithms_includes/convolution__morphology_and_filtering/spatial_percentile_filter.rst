A Spatial Percentile Filter is an image filtering technique that aims to enhance or suppress certain features in an image based on their intensity values. It is a non-linear filter that replaces the value of a pixel with a specified percentile value of its neighborhood.


Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select the raster to process  and modify the parameterization if necessary, then click :guilabel:`run`.

3. Processed image in comparison to the original.
