Spatial morphological Binary Propagation filter performs multi-dimensional binary propagation with a given structuring element, spreading the influence of 1 pixels in a binary image to neighboring pixels based on a predefined connectivity criterion.

When applying this algorithm to continous image data, the input will be binarised.


Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select the raster to process  and modify the parameterization if necessary, then click :guilabel:`run`.
