The filter operates by moving a kernel across the image and replacing the pixel within the window with the minimum pixel value found within that window. The size of the window determines the extent of the filterâ€™s effect on the image.


Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select the raster to process  and modify the parameterization if necessary, then click :guilabel:`run`.

    .. figure:: ./img/min_filter_interface.png
       :align: center

3. Processed image in comparison to the original.

    .. figure:: ./img/min_filter_result.png
       :align: center
