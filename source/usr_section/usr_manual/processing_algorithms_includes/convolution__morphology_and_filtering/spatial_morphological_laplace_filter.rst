The Spatial morphological Laplace filter is used to enhance and detect edges or transitions in an image. It combines morphological dilation and erosion operations to isolate high-frequency components associated with image edges.


Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select the raster to process  and modify the parameterization if necessary, then click :guilabel:`run`.
