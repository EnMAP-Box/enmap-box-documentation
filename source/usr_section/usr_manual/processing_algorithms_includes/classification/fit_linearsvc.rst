A Linear SVM works by finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between two classes while minimizing classification error. It is a powerful algorithm for linearly separable datasets.

Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select a training dataset or create one by clicking the processing algorithm icon, then click :guilabel:`run`.
