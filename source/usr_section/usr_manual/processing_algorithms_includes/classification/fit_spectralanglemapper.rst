The Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier works by comparing the spectral angles between the spectral signature of a pixel and reference spectral signatures for various classes. SAM is advantageous for hyperspectral image classification because it takes into account the spectral information across many narrow wavelength bands, allowing it to capture subtle differences in spectral signatures.It is particularly useful in scenarios where different materials or land cover types have similar spectral shapes but differ in their angles in hyperspectral space.

Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select a training dataset or create one by clicking the processing algorithm icon, then click :guilabel:`run`.
