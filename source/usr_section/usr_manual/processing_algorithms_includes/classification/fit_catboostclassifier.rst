This algorithm creates a trained Catboost classifier. CatBoost is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It works sequentially by adding trees one by one to correct errors made by the previous ones.

Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select a training dataset or create one by clicking the processing algorithm icon, then click :guilabel:`run`.
