Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select a raster to process.

3. Under :guilabel:`Class mapping` note which raster values shall be reclassified by writing the original value, followed by the new value, e. g. [1:1, 2:1, 3:2 ...]. In this example, classes 1 and 2 will be combined into a new class 1, while class 3 will be assigned a new value of 2.

4. Optionally you can define class names and visualisation under :guilabel:`Categories` as seen in the example below. Then, click :guilabel:`run`.
