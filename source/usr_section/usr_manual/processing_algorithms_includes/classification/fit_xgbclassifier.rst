An XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) classifier is an ensemble learning algorithm based on decision trees.XGBoost builds an ensemble of decision trees and uses gradient boosting to improve model accuracy.

Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select a training dataset or create one by clicking the processing algorithm icon, then click :guilabel:`run`.
