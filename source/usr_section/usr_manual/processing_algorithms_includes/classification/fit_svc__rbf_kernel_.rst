A Support Vector Machine (SVM) using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel allows SVMs to handle non-linearly separable data by transforming it into a higher-dimensional space.

Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select a training dataset or create one by clicking the processing algorithm icon, then click :guilabel:`run`.
