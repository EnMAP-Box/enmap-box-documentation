A Polynomial Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a variant of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm that uses polynomial kernel functions to classify data. It is particularly useful when the decision boundary between classes is not linear and exhibits polynomial patterns.

Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select a training dataset or create one by clicking |processingAlgorithm|, then click :guilabel:`run`.
