Logistic Regression models the probability of a binary or multi-class outcome by applying a logistic function to a linear combination of input features. It tries to minimize the difference between predicted probabilities and actual labels through optimization.

Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select a training dataset or create one by clicking the processing algorithm icon, then click :guilabel:`run`.
