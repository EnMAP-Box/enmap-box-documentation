Kernel PCA is an extension of Principal Component Analysis that allows for non-linear dimensionality reduction. It implicitly maps data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable, performs standard PCA in that space, and then projects the results back into the original feature space.

Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select a raster layer to process and click :guilabel:`run`.
