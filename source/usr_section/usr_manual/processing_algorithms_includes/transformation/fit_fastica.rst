FastICA separates a multivariate signal into additive, statistically independent components. It assumes that the sources are linearly mixed, non-Gaussian, and mutually independent.

Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select a raster layer to process and click :guilabel:`run`.
