Feature agglomeration groups similar features in a dataset to reduce dimensionality while preserving the most important information. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data, as it can help reduce the computational complexity of subsequent analysis, eliminate noise, and potentially improve model performance.

Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select a raster layer to process and click :guilabel:`run`.
