BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies) is an algorithm for efficiently clustering large datasets by creating a hierarchical structure of clusters through node splitting and merging operations.

Usage:

1. Open the algorithm form the processing toolbox.

2. Load an existing training dataset or create one by clicking |processingAlgorithm|, then click :guilabel:`run`.
