K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct, non-overlapping groups or clusters.K-means clustering aims to minimize the within-cluster variance or sum of squared distances from data points to their assigned cluster centroids.

Usage:

1. Open the algorithm from the processing toolbox.

2. Load an existing training dataset or create one by clicking the processing algorithm icon, then click :guilabel:`run`.
