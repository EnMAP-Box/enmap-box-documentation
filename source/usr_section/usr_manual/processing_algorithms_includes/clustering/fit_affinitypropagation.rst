Affinity Propagation creates clusters by identifying exemplars that best capture the data's structure. It adapts to the data's inherent similarities and differences and does not require a pre-specified number of clusters, making it useful for discovering clusters with varying sizes and shapes.

Usage:

1. Open the algorithm from the processing toolbox.

2. Load an existing training dataset or create one by clicking the processing algorithm icon, then click :guilabel:`run`.
