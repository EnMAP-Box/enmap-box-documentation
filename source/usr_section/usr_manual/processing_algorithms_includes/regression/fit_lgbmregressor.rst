LGBM is a powerful and efficient algorithm for regression tasks. It is well-suited for a wide range of applications, including problems with large datasets and high-dimensional feature spaces. When using LGBM, it is essential to fine-tune hyperparameters and monitor the training process to achieve the best model performance.

Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select a training dataset or create one by clicking the processing algorithm icon, then click :guilabel:`run`.
