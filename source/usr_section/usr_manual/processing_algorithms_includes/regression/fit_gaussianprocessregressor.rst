A Gaussian Process Regressor is a probabilistic machine learning model utilizing a non-parametric and Bayesian approach for modeling the relationship between input features and output values. It is particularly useful when dealing with problems where the underlying data distribution is not known and when uncertainty in predictions is important.

Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select a training dataset or create one by clicking the processing algorithm icon, then click :guilabel:`run`.
