Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression is a statistical technique used for modeling the relationship between a set of independent variables (features or predictors) and a dependent variable (target) when there is multicollinearity and when there are more predictors than observations. PLS combines elements of principal component analysis and multiple linear regression to find a linear relationship between the variables while reducing the dimensionality of the predictor space.

Usage:

1. Start the algorithm from the Processing Toolbox panel.

2. Select a training dataset or create one by clicking the processing algorithm icon, then click :guilabel:`run`.
