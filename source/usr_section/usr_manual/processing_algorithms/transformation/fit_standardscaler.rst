  ## AUTOGENERATED DESCRIPTION START

Standardize `features <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-feature>`_ by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
The standard score of a `sample <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-sample>`_ x is calculated as:
z = \(x - u\) / s
where u is the mean of the training `samples <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-sample>`_ or zero if with_mean=False, and s is the standard deviation of the training samples or one if with_std=False.
Centering and scaling happen independently on each `feature <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-feature>`_ by computing the relevant statistics on the samples in the training set. Mean and standard deviation are then stored to be used on later data using transform.
Standardization of a `dataset <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-dataset>`_ is a common requirement for many machine learning `estimators <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-estimator>`_: they might behave badly if the individual features do not more or less look like standard normally distributed data \(e.g. Gaussian with 0 mean and unit variance\).
For instance many elements used in the objective function of a learning algorithm \(such as the RBF kernel of Support Vector Machines or the L1 and L2 regularizers of linear models\) assume that all features are centered around 0 and have variance in the same order. If a feature has a variance that is orders of magnitude larger that others, it might dominate the objective function and make the `estimator <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-estimator>`_ unable to learn from other features correctly as expected.

  ## AUTOGENERATED PARAMETERS START

**Parameters**

:guilabel:`Transformer` [string]
    Scikit-learn python code. See `StandardScaler <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html>`_ for information on different parameters.
    Default::

        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

        transformer = StandardScaler\(\)

:guilabel:`Raster layer with features` [raster]
    `Raster layer <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-raster-layer>`_ with `feature <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-feature>`_ data `X <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-x>`_ used for fitting the `transformer <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-transformer>`_. Mutually exclusive with parameter: `Training dataset <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-training-dataset>`_

:guilabel:`Sample size` [number]
    Approximate number of `samples <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-sample>`_ drawn from raster. If 0, whole raster will be used. Note that this is only a hint for limiting the number of rows and columns.
    Default: *1000*

:guilabel:`Training dataset` [file]
    `Training dataset <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-training-dataset>`_ `pickle file <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-pickle-file>`_ used for fitting the `transformer <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-transformer>`_. Mutually exclusive with parameter: `Raster layer <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-raster-layer>`_ with `features <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-feature>`_

**Outputs**

:guilabel:`Output transformer` [fileDestination]
    `Pickle file <https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/glossary.html#term-pickle-file>`_ destination.
