EnSoMap - Tutorial
===================
In this tutorial we will generate and validate maps of topsoil properties from hyperspectral data using the EnSoMAP tool within the EnMAP-Box. 
The tutorial can also be found as screencast on YouTube_:

Data
"""""
You can download a subset of HyMap airborne imagery `here <Link>`_,  which can be used to reproduce this tutorial.

The data was acquired over agricultural areas in the Cabo de Gata-NÃ­jar Natural Park, a semi-arid Mediterranean area in southern Spain. The region is only sparsely populated and offers a range of landscape patterns, from Mediterranean steppe, dunes, and salt mines to cliffs. The vegetation cover experienced a decline, followed by a recovery of climax types like Stipa and Palmito in the past 50 years. Today, the area is mainly used for agricultural practices, mining, tourist activities as well as a few built-up areas. The soils developed on volcanic and carbonatic bedrocks are highly variable in their textural and mineralogical composition, thus we can observe an interesting spectral variability.
