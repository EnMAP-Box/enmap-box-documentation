"*_peaks_*","Data products based on local reflectance peaks only. (e.g. green peak vegetation, red peak hematite)"
"*_average_*","Data products based on average correlation scores of local reflectance peaks  (e.g. green peak vegetation, red peak hematite) and characteristic absorption features."
"*_best_matches_*","Data products based on sorted correlation scores (the first band contains the highest score values, the second the second highest scores ...)"
"*_median_filtered_*","Data products which have been median filtered"
"*_correlation_result_*","Raw correlation scores from the spectral module for characteristic absorption features only."
"*_best_fit_*","Results relating to the highest correlation score (Band 1 of best matches)"
"*_abundance_*","BVLS Results"
"*_highest_abundance_*","Data products based on sorted BVLS scores (the first band contains the highest score values, the second the second highest scores ...)"
"*_abundance_result_*","Raw BVLS scores from the spectral module for characteristic absorption features only."
"*_geotiff_*","Standard RGB color maps assigned from the sorted Band 1 of the best_matches results using the .csv colorfile May be directly viewed with the image viewer of your choice."
"*_indices_*", "Indices of the material with respect to the sorted correlation/abundance order. Please note that -999 represents a no data placeholder."
"*_coleur_files_*.hdr", "Class images, may be used for a quick legend generation within the QGIS map composer. Class image colors are, however, unreliable, use only geotiff for map display!"
