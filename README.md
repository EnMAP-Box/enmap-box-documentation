# EnMAP-Box Documentation
This is the documentation of EnMAP-Box


# Requirements
To build the documentation with Sphinx the packages listed in `requirements.txt` need to be installed.


For some maintenance scripts in `/scripts` it is required that the EnMAP-Box source code repository
(`enmap-box`) is located in the same folder as this documentation  (`enmap-box-documentation`).
Furthermore, they need to be started in a PyQGIS environment, i.e. you can run `import qgis` in python.


# Build the documentation

Open a terminal and run (linux) `make html`, or (windows) `make.bat html`.
